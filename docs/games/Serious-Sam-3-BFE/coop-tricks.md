# Coop Tricks
Generally, coop runs will follow very similar routes to singleplayer. There are a few coop-exclusive tricks that help however.

## Coop Settings
You are allowed to customize server settings for runs. You will have to use the Classic Coop mode to be able to do this. Useful settings are:

Extra Multiplayer Enemies: Off    
Infinite Ammo: On    
Respawn Credits: Infinite        
Invulnerable After Spawning: 10s    

Respawn in place should be on for the main campaign, and off for JotN.

Friendly fire may also be useful to turn on for ILs, so that you can kill each other to force respawning invulnerability.

## Death Warps
With respawn in place off, whenever you respawn you will do so at the latest checkpoint. This can let players catch up to whoever's furthest ahead.

If respawn in place is on, you can still respawn at a checkpoint by dying to environmental damage - fall damage, turrets, the ball in last man on earth. If you die too close to a wall, where you might respawn in it, you might also respawn at the checkpoint.

Note that sometimes, even with respawn in place off you will still respawn in place. The reason for this is not yet known.

## Water ouf of bounds
If you die next to a ceiling underwater with spawn in place activated, you will end up spawning out of bounds.

## Framerate
Player's framerates are entirely independent of each other. One player can be at 15fps, and will get 15fps physics, at the exact same time as another is uncapped, and gets uncapped physics.

## Rocket Jumps
Regardless of ping, only the host can rocket jump. In splitscreen all players can rocket jump.

## Sandwhale Manipulation
Each world containing a Sandwhale only actually has a single one. Normally it will teleport around the map whenever you wander too far into the desert. It only teleports if it is not already agroed, however, if it simply switches from one target to another it will run from where it was last. This means that one player can lure it towards themselves, giving another one more time to pass through risky areas before it catches up.
