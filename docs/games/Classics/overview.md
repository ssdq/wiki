# Overview

## Tricks

### General

#### Buffer jumps

While in the air or on certain slippery terrain, holding the jump button will cause the player character to jump as soon as possible. In the former case, this is most often used to preserve momentum, as some is lost due to friction when you have contact with the ground.

#### Out of bounds

You get to fly around.

### Tourist/Easy

#### Cannon-jumping

### Normal and up

#### Rocket-jumping

### Co-op

#### Player marker use

When respawning after death, you can choose to respawn at the most recently activated player marker by holding your Reload key. You will also spawn at the most recently activated player marker if you reconnect (F9 or Quick Load as client) or join a game in progress.

#### Friendly-fire boosts

##### Shotgun

##### Tommy gun

##### Laser

#### Water OOB
