![spawn6](images/02/spawn6.jpg)
![spawn7](images/02/spawn7.jpg)
![spawn8](images/02/spawn8.jpg)
Spawn 9 is activated by the door controller

This is the spot where you can go out of bounds by rubbing yourself against this surface (yellow) and jump-buffering repeatedly

This is the level end TouchField

### General notes
If carrying Serious Speed from the previous level, you can skip an entire cycle of the moving bounce pad by jumping perfectly, but this requires a lot of precision and possibly a boost from other players.
