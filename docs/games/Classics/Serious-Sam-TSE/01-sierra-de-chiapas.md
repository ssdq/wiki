### Player markers
Here are the player markers and what you need to pick up or touch to activate them:

![spawn2](images/01/spawn2.jpg)
![spawn3](images/01/spawn3.jpg)
![spawn4](images/01/spawn4.jpg)
![spawn5](images/01/spawn5.jpg)
![spawn6](images/01/spawn6.jpg)
![spawn21](images/01/spawn21.jpg)

This is the spot where you can go out of bounds by either rocket jumping twice, or getting sniped while jumping straight up on someone's head

This spot is interesting: if you enter water from out of bounds, the TouchField will not trigger; it will trigger and spawn fish upon exiting rather than entering

### General notes
When you spawn in the air, you have movement control for a brief moment, meaning you can hold forward and get a significant push forward.
For full-game runs, 3 or 4 out of 6 players can take Serious Speed for the next level.
