TFE/01-general-tricks/","text":"General Tricks \u00b6 Movement based \u00b6 Strafe jumping \u00b6 Strafe jumping increases your movement speed by up to 10%. Simply jump and tap the left and right movement keys repeatedly while in the air. You will gain small speed boosts which depend on how quickly you tap the movement keys, although tapping too quickly will nullify the effect. Buffer jumps \u00b6 Crouch swimming \u00b6 Swim faster by holding either crouch while on the floor, or jump while at the roof. You will swim about twice as fast, but will be unable to turn while doing it. Crouch to halt speed \u00b6 Frame rate based \u00b6 Object boosting \u00b6 Due to a collision glitch, certain objects are able to boost you when you interact with them in a certain way, sending you great distances at extremely fast speeds. In order for the glitch to work, an FPS of roughly 200 is required, and any higher FPS does not appear to increase the power of the boost. Clipping through the ground \u00b6 There is a glitch which makes it possible to clip through the ground by pressing crouch as you are about to land from being airborne. The glitch is dependent on frame rate, your altitude and speed, and the thickness of the ground geometry. The lower the frame rate and the longer you fall as well as the thinner geometry, the higher the chances of clipping through the ground. It is possible to do it on 60 FPS in order to combine it with Harpy flying, but it does rely on extreme falling heights, thus 30 FPS is required for shorter distances. Only works on an older version in TSE as it was patched out. Turbo Laser \u00b6 By binding primary fire to the mouse wheel, the Lasergun can fire three times as fast on 60 FPS (dealing 600 DPS - second only to Cannon), or even faster on higher FPS. Only works on an older version in TSE as it was patched out. Enemy Based \u00b6 Harpy jumping and flying \u00b6 Just like with the Floating Gnaar, it is possible to reach any height with a Harpy. First make it fly into a wall or stun it (only works on 30 FPS), then jump on to its back and scroll wheel jump. It works the same way as with the Floating Gnaar, except the Harpy will continuously kick you while you are standing on it, possibly canceling out the jumps. The kicking attacks can in turn be used to gain extremely fast horizontal speed. You will start floating towards the kicking direction, and for each consecutive kick, your speed will increase. However, you will need to move towards the center of the Harpy after every few kicks to adjust your position, otherwise you will be knocked off, although the higher FPS you play on, the harder it is to get knocked off. By combining the jumping and the horizontal boost you can basically fly around the levels, and you can instantly fall off by crouching. Floating with Floating Gnaars \u00b6 Unlike in non-HD, the Floating Gnaars do not float higher if you simply keep jumping on them. However, you can trick them to do so by jumping horizontally out of their attacking range, making them move towards you to attack. By moving towards them and landing on them again, you will be floating horizontally towards the opposite direction of where you were attacked from. It is possible to float faster by having a second Floating Gnaar push on the other one. If you scroll wheel jump after performing the horizontal jump, the Floating Gnaar will keep following you upwards, meaning you can also quickly reach any height (easier on a high FPS). Finally, you can make them sink by crouching while standing on them. Bull jumping and riding \u00b6 Bull jumping is performed by standing on top of a Werebull and jumping when it is about to attack. The altitude reached is timing dependent, but a perfect bull jump gives roughly the same height as a standard bull boost in non-HD. Getting launched by two Werebulls throws you even higher into the air (double bull jumping). It is also possible to travel with the speed of a Werebull by getting on top of one while it is running. Usually it does not work if on even ground with the Werebull, so it is easier to do when it comes charging down a hill. After a while it will halt in order to attack you, but it is possible to cancel out the attack by jumping out of its attack range and landing back on again. You can also let its attack hit you while you jump to perform a boosted bull jump. Co-op \u00b6 Water out of bounds \u00b6 If you die next to a ceiling underwater with spawn in place activated, you will end up spawning out of bounds.

There are a few coop-exclusive tricks that help however. Coop Settings \u00b6 You are allowed to customize server settings for runs. You will have to use the Classic Coop mode to be able to do this. Useful settings are: Extra Multiplayer Enemies: Off Infinite Ammo: On Respawn Credits: Infinite Invulnerable After Spawning: 10s Respawn in place should be on for the main campaign, and off for JotN. Friendly fire may also be useful to turn on for ILs, so that you can kill each other to force respawning invulnerability. Death Warps \u00b6 With respawn in place off, whenever you respawn you will do so at the latest checkpoint. This can let players catch up to whoever's furthest ahead. If respawn in place is on, you can still respawn at a checkpoint by dying to environmental damage - fall damage, turrets, the ball in last man on earth. If you die too close to a wall, where you might respawn in it, you might also respawn at the checkpoint. Note that sometimes, even with respawn in place off you will still respawn in place. The reason for this is not yet known. Water ouf of bounds \u00b6 If you die next to a ceiling underwater with spawn in place activated, you will end up spawning out of bounds. Framerate \u00b6 Player's framerates are entirely independent of each other. One player can be at 15fps, and will get 15fps physics, at the exact same time as another is uncapped, and gets uncapped physics. Rocket Jumps \u00b6 Regardless of ping, only the host can rocket jump. In splitscreen all players can rocket jump. Sandwhale Manipulation \u00b6 Each world containing a Sandwhale only actually has a single one. Normally it will teleport around the map whenever you wander too far into the desert. It only teleports if it is not already agroed, however, if it simply switches from one target to another it will run from where it was last. This means that one player can lure it towards themselves, giving another one more time to pass through risky areas before it catches up.","title":"Coop Tricks"},{"location":"games/Serious-Sam-3-BFE/coop-tricks/#coop-tricks","text":"Generally, coop runs will follow very similar routes to singleplayer.

You may change your framerate limit with the following command, which defaults to 10,000: gfx_iMaxFPSActive=<value> Note that going below 10FPS will cause the game to run slower. Buffer Jumps \u00b6 If you hold jump in mid-air you will jump the moment you hit the ground. You can only buffer once per press, so you will have to release and re-press jump in mid-air again if you wish to chain it. These are useful as a way to keep any extra speed you have over the normal walking/sprinting speed. If you hold any directional key you will accelerate towards the default movement speed - so if you're going faster you'll be slowed down. Just landing on the ground will also kill all your speed pretty quickly, so by buffering jumps you can keep the speed going for longer. Bump Jumps \u00b6 By jumping at a low object and bumping into it's (upper) corner, you will gain extra height compared to a regular jump. Lower framerates tend to give more height, but make actually getting the bump harder, though this is not a universal rule. Your horizontal speed when you get the bump also affects the height you get, though generally not by a meaningful amount. Low FPS Clips \u00b6 At very low framerates it becomes possible to slide through small gaps. A notable example of these is on key doors, which have a small gap between the frame and the doorway. By approaching these from the right angle at low enough framerates, you can squeeze through the gap and appear to clip to the other side. Low FPS Jumps \u00b6 At very low framerates you jump up to a meter further than high ones. Mutilator Boosting \u00b6 If you try use the mutilator on large enemies they will pull you towards themselves, quite quickly. The direction you will be pulled is locked in as soon as the enemy's animation starts. This means you can strafe to the side so that you don't hit them, and then start buffering jumps to keep the extra speed from the pull. Physics Boosts \u00b6 Certain geometry can give you massive boosts. Generally these are caused by squeezing yourself somewhere you shouldn't be able to fit, though sometimes just walking into the geometry has the same effect. The game will try to force you out of the spot once per frame, meaning that the higher your framerate the more speed it gives you. You can then use buffer jumps to keep all this speed as long as you want. Sometimes you may want to not get a boost, in which case lowering your framerate should make it less intense and/or rarer. Note that crouching will instantly kill all of your speed, which may be useful if during a boost you start overshooting. Stuck Boosts \u00b6 Stuck Boosts are a small variation of Physics Boosts. Rather than being boosted straight out, in a Stuck Boost you get stuck in the geometry, and continue building up speed as long as you want. Sometimes you can manually leave the spot you're stuck in, typically by jumping, other times you'll just have to wait until to build up too much speed to stay stuck. Stuck Boosts have a characteristic pitch rise due to the doppler effect. Rocket Jumps \u00b6 Walk up to a tree or wall the crouch and shoot a rocket in very quick succession. You can start a rocket jump in mid-air, which tends to help getting on top of walls. Rocket jumps are doable on all difficulties, though they will deal up to 50 self-damage on normal and above. Crouch Sliding \u00b6 If you land on a downwards slope after a rocket jump you can crouch to slide down it, preserving some momentum. Sky Sharking \u00b6 At very low framerates it is possible to swim past the water-air boundary without the game noticing, and then continue swimming in mid-air. Swimming downwards in any way will break the glitch, and cause you to start falling. Due to differences in the swimming and standing hitboxes, you can also use sky sharking to clip through some thin, double-sided ceilings. Doing so will cause you to lose the glitch however. While sky sharking you can also pass through some invisible walls that you can't while standing. Sledgehammer Glitch \u00b6 The sledgehammer is the only weapon you can use while sprinting. If you start sprinting, then try to switch to a different weapon, you will keep holding the sledge until you stop sprinting, and it will inherit the firerate of the weapon you switched to, letting you swing it more often. Works best with switching to pistol. Slope Boosting \u00b6 Whenever you land on a slope, some of your downwards vertical speed gets turned into horizontal speed away from the slope. This means that jumping up a slope will reduce your speed, but jumping down a slope will give you a speed boost.","title":"General Tricks"},{"location":"games/Serious-Sam-3-BFE/general-tricks/#general-tricks","text":"","title":"General Tricks"},{"location":"games/Serious-Sam-3-BFE/general-tricks/#framerate","text":"Many tricks in the game are framerate based.

Any% \u00b6 Intro \u00b6 Start off by running to the left and getting the secret sledgehammer. Then drop down one rooftop and walk off the edge. While in midair release sprint and so that you can switch to the sledgehammer. The sledgehammer will be needed for skips later. By dropping down one rooftop you will barely be able to survive walking off the edge, with about 15 health, while taking a shorter route. Jumping will kill you. You can also bump against the many small lips on the way down to cancel fall damage, but this takes longer. There is no friction in midair, so you can safely release sprint without losing time. Doing so will allow you to switch weapons, which will finish by the time you hit the ground so that you can start sprinting again. Streets \u00b6 Follow the intended path down the streets a bit. In the first alleyway you will come to a destructible wall that a gnar is knocking down. You can destroy this (and kill the gnar) with a single sledgehammer swing yourself to get through quicker. Make sure to pay attention to if your sledgehammer is raised or not, it can be worth waiting for it to raise in order to get the quicker attack animation. On the next road normally you'd duck into another alley on the right. You can instead skip this section by jumping over the gate blocking you. You can make the jump from either the desk or the sandbags, though note that the desk is destructible. If you miss the initial jump you can also try jump off of one of the gnars that will be blocking you. Spaceship Skip \u00b6 At the end of the next road you will come to the spaceship area. We will be skipping it entirely. Normally, once you finish the area a gnar will knock down a breakable wall to let you exit. Like before, you can knock this down yourself with two sledgehammer swings, which skips the whole fight. There is an additional skip you can do in this area too. Exactly 3.5s after you hit the starting trigger, you will be forced to look at the spaceship. Normally this forces your camera to slowly turn towards it. However, if you're already looking at that spot, it does nothing, and instantly gives back your camera control. If you time it right you can jump and turn to look at it just as it does this check, and then turn back before the jump lands, so that you don't waste any time not being able to sprint due to not looking the right direction. The Boost \u00b6 After the spaceship arena, follow the intended path for a bit until you pass under though the building. Turn left, kill the gnar that will block you, and walk up to the dumpster. Perform a physics boost off of this dumpter. To get the boost just line up in the right spot, shown below, then jump and hold forwards. You may want to switch to a pistol after killing the gnar so that you have a crosshair, but with practice you'll be able to do it without. Note that the more FPS you have the better, so you should be looking straight down, the example is just looking higher for better reference. Take the boost as far as possible, then follow the intended route for the rest of the level. Any% Coop \u00b6 If a client triggers the spaceship cutscene, then nobody will have their view forced towards it, meaning there's no need to attempt the skip. The wall you knock down in the spaceship arena takes two hits, so if two players get there at the same time they can do both hits at once. Note that this does not work if you have friendly fire on, one person will hit the other. Outside of these two things, the level plays exactly like in singleplayer, just have everyone try follow the same route and whoever messes up least finishes the level.","title":"Summer in Cairo"},{"location":"games/Serious-Sam-3-BFE/01-summer-in-cairo/#summer-in-cairo","text":"","title":"Summer in Cairo"},{"location":"games/Serious-Sam-3-BFE/01-summer-in-cairo/#level-end-trigger","text":"This level ends upon hitting the following trigger in the entrance to the museum.","title":"Level End Trigger"},{"location":"games/Serious-Sam-3-BFE/01-summer-in-cairo/#any","text":"","title":"Any%"},{"location":"games/Serious-Sam-3-BFE/01-summer-in-cairo/#intro","text":"Start off by running to the left and getting the secret sledgehammer.

Any% \u00b6 The Darkness \u00b6 The level with start with you in the darkness, without a flashlight. It will turn on in a few seconds, but waiting wastes time. You'll want to immediately turn right and climb up the staircase - while in the dark. The \"simple\" way of doing this is just to learn the muscle memory to turn your camera just the right distance. There is a lot of annoying geometry you can get stuck on even if you just slightly over or undershoot, so there are a few other options you might want to consider. Firstly, changing your colour settings, specifically gamma correction, can make it much easier to see in the dark. This however requires playing in fullscreen, and you will have to use the settings for the entire run, it is not worth it to switch settings just for this small segment. Another option is to abuse muzzle flash. Whenever you shoot, it will very briefly light up the room, letting you get your bearings. This is especially effective when looking at the tile grid on the floor. You can double check if you've made it up the stairs by looking for the health pack down the hallway. This doesn't come into view early enough to be useful to orient yourself however. Whatever method you choose, make your way up the staircase and follow the intended route into the foyer. Spider Cutscene Skip \u00b6 Up in the foyer normally you'd have a small cutscene forcing your view into the middle of it, and, more significantly, slowing your movement speed. As the title might suggest, you can skip this. The cutscene start upon hitting the following trigger. To skip the cutscene, you need to have something agro on you before hitting the trigger. Just shooting your pistol once is enough to do this. It's best to shoot in the middle of a jump, so that you don't lose time due to not sprinting. Statue Climb \u00b6 Next climb the statue on the right side of the room to get to the second floor. The climb works on both sides of the statue, with minor differences, but as the right side is closer, you should aim to learn the climb on it. High framerates make it extremely difficult/impossible, so it is very highly recommended to cap to 30fps. Learning the climb really just requires practicing it. Jump onto the statue's lap from the walkway to the right, then walk as far up the arm as you can go before jumping on the shoulder. Once on the shoulder just holding forwards should get you to the very top, though you may occasionally want to jump to kill extra momentum. Speedrun Secret \u00b6 Once you've climbed up the statue you'll want to activate the speedrun secret. Yes, we'll be doing an intended skip. Unfortunately, you've just climbed up near where it ends, and will need to walk all around the level to properly trigger it. Doing the statue climb is still quicker however. When you come to the end of the first balcony there's actually a small lip against the wall you can walk on to be able to follow this path. Once you've entered the doorway in the image above, continue along to the following bookcase. Destroy the bookcase. This will reveal a button, which you should then press. You can start swinging the sledgehammer significantly before you make it to bookcase, as long as you're next to it when the animation finishes. Once you've pressed the button, return back to where you started. Technically you could take the same path back in reverse, but it is quicker to drop down and do the statue climb again. Once you've climbed up the statue turn right instead, heading through the following door which should now be open. Boss Skip \u00b6 The level normally ends with a boss fight. However, as the Level End Trigger section might hint at, you do not need to kill it in order to finish the level. Here's the entrance to the boss arena, the grey wall being an invisible wall. Notably, there's a small lip sticking out past it not far from the entrance. This lip actually continues all the way over to the other side of the arena, meaning if you can get on it you can walk right over the boss and jump into the exit trigger. To do the skip, climb onto the higher entrance wall in the picture above, then just jump onto the lip. Don't aim right at the lip, aim to it's right, so that the edge of your model barely lands on it. It's also a good idea to make a quicksave beforehand, if you fall into the arena you can't get out. Once your on the lip just make sure to hug the (invisible) wall until you get over to the other side, and jump into the ending trigger. Any% Coop \u00b6 Just like the spaceship cutscene in Summer in Cairo , if a client hits the spider cutscene trigger first then no one will actually be affected by it. The skip only requires that a single player has agro, no restrictions on client/host or the order they hit the trigger, so it may also be worth just dedicating someone to always shoot. With multiple players, you can parallelize opening the speedrun secret. Two players can attempt to climb the statue at once, then the first to make it runs to the button, while all players others wait by the door. Because you can't quicksave in coop, if all players fail the boss skip you will have to fight it. Use the sledgehammer glitch to quickly kill it. Note that, even with just one player in the fight, the boss will die too quickly for the player who pressed the button to make it back to help, even if they immediately turn around.","title":"Into the Spider's Nest"},{"location":"games/Serious-Sam-3-BFE/02-spiders-nest/#into-the-spiders-nest","text":"","title":"Into the Spider's Nest"},{"location":"games/Serious-Sam-3-BFE/02-spiders-nest/#level-end-trigger","text":"This level ends upon hitting the following trigger behind the arachnid boss fight arena.","title":"Level End Trigger"},{"location":"games/Serious-Sam-3-BFE/02-spiders-nest/#any","text":"","title":"Any%"},{"location":"games/Serious-Sam-3-BFE/02-spiders-nest/#the-darkness","text":"The level with start with you in the darkness, without a flashlight.

This is especially effective when looking at the tile grid on the floor. You can double check if you've made it up the stairs by looking for the health pack down the hallway. This doesn't come into view early enough to be useful to orient yourself however. Whatever method you choose, make your way up the staircase and follow the intended route into the foyer.","title":"The Darkness"},{"location":"games/Serious-Sam-3-BFE/02-spiders-nest/#spider-cutscene-skip","text":"Up in the foyer normally you'd have a small cutscene forcing your view into the middle of it, and, more significantly, slowing your movement speed. As the title might suggest, you can skip this. The cutscene start upon hitting the following trigger. To skip the cutscene, you need to have something agro on you before hitting the trigger. Just shooting your pistol once is enough to do this. It's best to shoot in the middle of a jump, so that you don't lose time due to not sprinting.","title":"Spider Cutscene Skip"},{"location":"games/Serious-Sam-3-BFE/02-spiders-nest/#statue-climb","text":"Next climb the statue on the right side of the room to get to the second floor. The climb works on both sides of the statue, with minor differences, but as the right side is closer, you should aim to learn the climb on it. High framerates make it extremely difficult/impossible, so it is very highly recommended to cap to 30fps. Learning the climb really just requires practicing it. Jump onto the statue's lap from the walkway to the right, then walk as far up the arm as you can go before jumping on the shoulder. Once on the shoulder just holding forwards should get you to the very top, though you may occasionally want to jump to kill extra momentum.","title":"Statue Climb"},{"location":"games/Serious-Sam-3-BFE/02-spiders-nest/#speedrun-secret","text":"Once you've climbed up the statue you'll want to activate the speedrun secret. Yes, we'll be doing an intended skip. Unfortunately, you've just climbed up near where it ends, and will need to walk all around the level to properly trigger it. Doing the statue climb is still quicker however. When you come to the end of the first balcony there's actually a small lip against the wall you can walk on to be able to follow this path. Once you've entered the doorway in the image above, continue along to the following bookcase. Destroy the bookcase. This will reveal a button, which you should then press. You can start swinging the sledgehammer significantly before you make it to bookcase, as long as you're next to it when the animation finishes. Once you've pressed the button, return back to where you started. Technically you could take the same path back in reverse, but it is quicker to drop down and do the statue climb again. Once you've climbed up the statue turn right instead, heading through the following door which should now be open.","title":"Speedrun Secret"},{"location":"games/Serious-Sam-3-BFE/02-spiders-nest/#boss-skip","text":"The level normally ends with a boss fight. However, as the Level End Trigger section might hint at, you do not need to kill it in order to finish the level. Here's the entrance to the boss arena, the grey wall being an invisible wall. Notably, there's a small lip sticking out past it not far from the entrance. This lip actually continues all the way over to the other side of the arena, meaning if you can get on it you can walk right over the boss and jump into the exit trigger. To do the skip, climb onto the higher entrance wall in the picture above, then just jump onto the lip. Don't aim right at the lip, aim to it's right, so that the edge of your model barely lands on it. It's also a good idea to make a quicksave beforehand, if you fall into the arena you can't get out. Once your on the lip just make sure to hug the (invisible) wall until you get over to the other side, and jump into the ending trigger.","title":"Boss Skip"},{"location":"games/Serious-Sam-3-BFE/02-spiders-nest/#any-coop","text":"Just like the spaceship cutscene in Summer in Cairo , if a client hits the spider cutscene trigger first then no one will actually be affected by it. The skip only requires that a single player has agro, no restrictions on client/host or the order they hit the trigger, so it may also be worth just dedicating someone to always shoot. With multiple players, you can parallelize opening the speedrun secret. Two players can attempt to climb the statue at once, then the first to make it runs to the button, while all players others wait by the door. Because you can't quicksave in coop, if all players fail the boss skip you will have to fight it. Use the sledgehammer glitch to quickly kill it. Note that, even with just one player in the fight, the boss will die too quickly for the player who pressed the button to make it back to help, even if they immediately turn around.","title":"Any% Coop"}]}
