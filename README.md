## Contributing
At its most basic, you can simply edit files through GitHub's online editor. Make sure to check the preview before submitting a pull request.

For larger changes you may want to build the site locally first. Install all required packages, then you can launch a local, auto-updating server with the following commands:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt

mkdocs serve
```
